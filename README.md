This project is a fork (and a personal modification) of GeneticSharp. For all questions and requests, 
please consult the original author at https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp ,
unless it is releated to modification.

The modification is also licensed under MIT. Feel free to use it in any way you like -- but unlike
the strong code coverage and exceptional code quality of the original author, I do not guarantee it works
as expected.
