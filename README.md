Forked GeneticSharp

This project is a fork (and a personal modification) of GeneticSharp. For all questions and requests, 
please consult the original author at https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp ,
unless it is releated to modification.

All codes within the namespaces that does not ends with 'Generic' is due to the original author, and
those ends with Generics are mostly mindless rename-search-and-replace of the original author's work,
including TspWpf (whose main portion of logic is also a modification of the original author's Blazor sample)

The modification is also licensed under MIT. Feel free to use it in any way you like -- but unlike
the strong code coverage and exceptional code quality of the original author, I do not guarantee it works
as expected. This project was meant to be used by myself and is to provide the proof of concept for
GeneticSharp can successfully be combined with Generics.
